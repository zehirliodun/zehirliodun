# Contribute to the Programming Historian

The _Programming Historian_ runs on the energy of volunteers, and we welcome contributions from the community. Please consider the following ways to get involved, or let us know about other ideas you have for broadening participation.

## Write a new lesson

We welcome submissions of [new lessons][submissions] from authors!

Writing a tutorial is one of the best ways to teach yourself particular skills and actively engage in the digital humanities community.

We don't simply accept or reject articles like traditional journals. Our editors collaborate with you to help craft and hone your topic and approach, as well as to make your tutorial as clear and as useful as possible. Our peer review process helps improve your lessons even further, as well as improve your technical writing skills. Please read more about our [submission process][submissions].

If you'd like to propose a lesson (for you or for someone else to write), email <a href="mailto:jeri.elizabeth%2Bproghist@gmail.com">Jeri Wieringa</a>.

Academic peer review is essential for producing trusted high-quality resources. The _Programming Historian_, holds peer review in the highest regard, and we take an open and collaborative approach in which reviewers get full and public credit for their work. For more on our review philosophy and procedures, please see the [Guidelines for Reviewers][reviewers].

We hope you'll consider joining our team of reviewers. The time commitment is flexible, and you'll be contributing to helping us maintain high academic standards for this community resource. Please email <a href="mailto:jeri.elizabeth%2Bproghist@gmail.com">Jeri Wieringa</a> to introduce yourself and let us know about the specific skills, tools, topics, and technologies that you'd like to be involved with so that we can send you the most appropriate lessons to review.

Our editorial board members help facilitate peer review and work with authors closely to make improvements to their lessons. Our [guidelines for editors](http://programminghistorian.org/editor-guidelines) is meant to ensure that everyone, from authors to reviewers to members of the wider community, receive a fair and consistent experience during peer review.

From time to time we may advertise that we are seeking more editors.

## Provide feedback and report problems

We welcome [feedback](../feedback.html) on any aspect of the Programming Historian. Let us know what we can do to make the project better!

We are especially grateful for tips about lessons that seem to be broken. As URLs change and as new versions of software and platforms are released, lessons develop glitches over time. Please help us keep the _Programming Historian_ up to date by letting us know about these when you come across them in the course of your reading. 


## Add us to your Library Catalogue
